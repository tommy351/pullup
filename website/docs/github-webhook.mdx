`GitHubWebhook` defines a webhook which can be triggered by [GitHub webhook events](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/about-webhooks). This is useful for integrating Pullup into your GitHub repositories.

## Model

### `spec.triggers`

<p>
  <RequiredBadge />
</p>

See [`HTTPWebhook`](http-webhook.mdx#spectriggers) for more details.

### `spec.action`

- `name` <RequiredBadge /> - Full name of a repository. (e.g. `tommy351/pullup`)
- [`push`](#push)
- [`pullRequest`](#pullrequest)

You have to specify one of `push` or `pullRequest` field to activate the webhook.

## Setup

### Creating Webhooks on GitHub

See [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/creating-webhooks) for more details.

- **Payload URL**: `http://your-site.com/webhooks/github`
- **Content Type**: Choose `application/json`
- **Secret**: See [Securing Webhooks](#securing-webhooks) below.

### Securing Webhooks

It is recommended to set a secret on your webhook in order to make sure the payload is sent from GitHub. Set `GITHUB_SECRET` environment variable on the `pullup-webhook` deployment to enable this feature.

```yaml
env:
  - name: GITHUB_SECRET
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        key: github-secret
        name: pullup
```

## Examples

Only `GitHubWebhook` specific examples are provided below. See [`HTTPWebhook`](http-webhook.mdx#examples) for more examples.

### Basic

The following webhook only handles push events. Change `push` to `pullRequest` to handle pull request events instead. Noted that you can use both of them at the same time.

```yaml
apiVersion: pullup.dev/v1beta1
kind: GitHubWebhook
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  repositories:
    - name: foo/bar
      push: {}
  triggers:
    - name: foobar
```

### Filter by Branch

```yaml
apiVersion: pullup.dev/v1beta1
kind: GitHubWebhook
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  repositories:
    - name: foo/bar
      push:
        branches:
          include:
            - master
            - /release-.+/
          exclude:
            - canary
  triggers:
    - name: foobar
```
