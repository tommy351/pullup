## Quick Install

Install Pullup CRDs and components with the pre-generated YAML files.

```bash
# Install the latest version
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/tommy351/pullup/releases/latest/download/pullup-deployment.yml

# Install a specific version
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/tommy351/pullup/releases/download/v1.0.0/pullup-deployment.yml
```

The YAML file is generated with [kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize). You can see the source files in [deployment](https://github.com/tommy351/pullup/tree/master/deployment) folder, which contains:

- A namespace `pullup` which contains the following resources.
- Pullup custom resource definitions (CRD).
- A Service account `pullup`.
- RBAC for accessing Pullup CRD, writing events and the leader election.
- Deployments of the controller and the webhook.
- A service which exposes the webhook server.

## RBAC

After Pullup is installed, you have to grant access of the resources which will be used in triggers.

The following example includes `Deployment` and `Service`. See [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) for more details about RBAC.

import rbac from "!!raw-loader!../../examples/getting-started/rbac.yml";

<CodeBlock className="yaml" metastring={`title="rbac.yml"`}>
  {rbac}
</CodeBlock>

## Uninstall

To uninstall Pullup from your cluster, delete the `pullup` namespace.

```bash
kubectl delete ns pullup
```
